Mission: To help rescue good, adaptable dogs who are not getting the visits in the shelter have another chance to meet potential families. To match potential adopters with adoptable dogs that they might otherwise have been overlooked.
App is designed to accept entries from a shelter and offer a quiz for potential adopters to fill out and be matched to dogs who meet the most of these ideals.

Getting Started:
    To use the app, you must first fill in the database by logging in throught the shelter page and filling out a profile for each dog available for adoption.
    Loging in:
    Click on the Shelter button on the welcome window to navigate to the shelter page. Here you will find the log in promt.
    The default login is -
        Username: Shelter1
        Password: employeepassword
    Once you have logged in you can now add or remove dogs from the database.
        Add Dog: To add a dog, simple fill out the profile for the dog by answering the promts and then click 'Submit'. Dog's in database can not have duplicated names in the current version of Fetch. A success message will confirm the dog has been added.
        Remove Dog: Ignore the profile promt and skip to the 'Remove Adopted Dog' Enty box. Enter the dogs name and click 'Remove'. A success message will confirm the dog has been removed.

 Using the App for Potential adopters:
    Once the database has been populated, you can now have potential adopters use the form to be matched to dogs meeting their selections.
     Click on "Match with a Dog" Promt to be taken to the adopter form page. Once the window has opened, you can now fill out the form and click 'Fetch' to bring up a new window with the top three matches and the number of times they had a matching responses to the choice in the dog's profile.
